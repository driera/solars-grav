# Welcome to Solars theme for Grav


## Roadmap
    * Override `header.media_order` with `unset@: true` and add custom file input to upload media directly to a custom folder `/assets`. Then modify destination folder of filepickers to be `/assets`. [Here the issue on github](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-admin/issues/1465)
